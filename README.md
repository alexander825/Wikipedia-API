# Wikipedia-API
Use of and experimentation with MidiaWiki, Wikipedia's api. Attempt to later build a network of philosopher/scientists based on 'influences' and 'influenced' data on tehir pages.

The purpose of this is mostly to show my technical skills as I go through teh development for the project, so this section will read more like a journal than anything.



Day 2 - 3/29/2019
Continued digging into the MediaWiki webpages to understand the api. 
Found the package WikipediaR, which needs to be returned to bur unfortunately I couldnt get anything of value out of it.
Knowing how to pull the page data from day 1, I've edecided to move forward by parsing that semi-formatted text data. Begun writing a function to take a webpage and output the summary data that appears in a box on teh right side of wikipedia pages. 
This week I started writitng the code to parse th esemi-structured text data into an R object about the given person.
